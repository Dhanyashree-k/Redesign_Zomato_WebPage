# 🍽️ Zomato Website Redesign – UX Case Study

### 🎯 Objective  
To improve the **user experience (UX)** and **visual clarity** of the Zomato website’s homepage by simplifying navigation, enhancing readability, and giving it a more modern, user-friendly look.

---

### 🧠 Problem Statement  
While exploring the original Zomato website, I noticed several UX and UI issues that could be improved for better usability:

- Cluttered homepage layout with too many sections grouped closely  
- Search bar looked small and cramped  
- Inconsistent color hierarchy — all text appeared similar in weight  
- Uneven spacing between cards and sections  
- Minimal use of icons for quick visual scanning  

These issues made the homepage feel a bit heavy and less intuitive for first-time users.

### 🎨 Design Improvements  

| Area | Before | After |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Navigation Tabs** | All black, minimal contrast | Active tab (Dining Out) highlighted in red for clarity |
| **Search Bar** | Small text and tight layout | Enlarged input, improved readability, better spacing |
| **Section Titles** | Plain black text | Added icons for better visual hierarchy |
| **Category Chips** | Glitchy text alignment | Replaced with clean emoji-style icons (e.g., 🐟 Seafood, 🍲 South Indian) |
| **Spacing & Layout** | Crowded blocks | Increased padding, consistent grid system |
| **Visual Hierarchy** | Flat color scheme | Used subtle grays and accent red to highlight key sections |

Overall, the redesign enhances **visual hierarchy, accessibility, and ease of use** while keeping Zomato’s recognizable brand aesthetic.
